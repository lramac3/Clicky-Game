# Welcome to Clicky Game of Thrones

Clicky game is a react application wherein user can click on GOT character cards to score points. But, user can only click on a character's card once. If the user clicks on the same character's card more than once, the game ends. The game keeps track of the highest score of the current session. If user scores 18 without any repeats, user wins and the game resets.
